This project focuses on predicting future stock prices using historical market data and machine learning models. The primary goal is to analyze trends, identify patterns, and make predictions about future stock prices of selected companies.

The dataset used includes historical stock data such as Open, High, Low, Close prices, and trading Volume. The data is cleaned, visualized, and processed using feature engineering techniques. Various models such as Linear Regression, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), and Random Forest are implemented and compared based on their performance.

The LSTM model, which is particularly suited for time-series forecasting, showed the most promising results due to its ability to learn from sequential data. Evaluation metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) are used to assess the model accuracy.

This project demonstrates how AI and data science can be used in financial markets to make informed investment decisions.
